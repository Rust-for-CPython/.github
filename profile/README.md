# Rust for CPython

Rust for CPython is a community effort to introduce [the Rust progamming language](https://rust-lang.org/) to [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython/), the default Python implementation.

Most of the work will occur in the [Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) repository](https://github.com/Rust-for-CPython/peps) and a [CPython fork with a reference implementation](https://github.com/Rust-for-CPython/cpython).
